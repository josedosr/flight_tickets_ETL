# Flight Tickets Project: Web Scraping

### Introduction

Welcome to our data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) application! Developed collaboratively, this app empowers users to gather data from popular travel websites such as eDreams and KAYAK through web scraping techniques. Once the data is harvested, our application processes it into a uniform format, enabling seamless integration with the AirTable database via API. Join us on this journey as we delve into the world of travel data, extracting valuable insights and uncovering hidden gems within our vast collection of information.

### Process Steps

#### 1. Web Scraping:

- We utilize web scraping to download data from eDreams and KAYAK pages.
- Relevant information about flights, destinations, prices, and travel dates is extracted.

#### 2. Data Processing:

- Downloaded data is processed to standardize its format.
- Transformations are applied to ensure consistency and coherence in the data structure.
- Data is prepared for subsequent loading into the AirTable database.

#### 3. Integration with AirTable:

- The AirTable API is used to load processed data into our centralized database.
- Data is organized and stored orderly for easy access and management.

#### 4. Data Analysis:

- Data stored in AirTable is extracted for comprehensive analysis.
- Libraries such as Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium are employed to create impactful visualizations.
- Trends, patterns, and relationships in the data are explored to extract valuable insights.

#### 5. Data Enrichment:

- The Foursquare API is utilized to find points of interest at travel destinations.
- Additional information about places of interest, restaurants, activities, and more is added to our dataset.

Join us on this exciting journey as we explore and analyze travel data to discover new experiences and opportunities!
